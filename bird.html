    <p>Singapore is one of the favourite tourist destinations for people from India. Apart from offering wide range of experiences the country has now added a new site to its vibrant repertoire. The country has announced the soft opening of Bird Paradise on May 8, 2023.

        <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Location</span>
        
        <br><br>The new park will be located within the integrated nature and wildlife destination of Mandai Wildlife Reserve in northern Singapore, which is also home to the Night Safari, River Wonders and Singapore Zoo.
        
        Also opening next to Bird Paradise, is a new ungated public node called Mandai Wildlife West, which has playgrounds and an array of dining and retail options, and serves as the gateway to the new park. The opening of the new attraction will give families another enticing reason to fly to Singapore for their holidays during the peak school holiday travel season.
